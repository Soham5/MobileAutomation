# Mobile Test Automation Java Project

Welcome to the Mobile Test Automation Java Project! This repository serves as a comprehensive example of mobile test automation using Java, showcasing different testing frameworks and reporting tools. Whether you are a novice eager to learn about mobile automation or an experienced tester seeking insights into various frameworks and reporting options, this project aims to provide a valuable reference.

## Overview

This project demonstrates the integration of multiple Java-based mobile testing frameworks and reporting tools. It includes sample test scripts for Android and iOS platforms, highlighting the versatility and capabilities of popular frameworks such as Appium and TestNG. Additionally, the project incorporates reporting tools like Allure and ExtentReports to enhance test result visibility.

## Prerequisites

Before running the tests, ensure you have the following software installed:

- [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) and/or [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) for respective platform testing
- [Appium](http://appium.io/) for mobile automation
